  title:        "RGB LED Matrix Driver"
  description:  "Drives a simple animation on SparkFun's RGB LED 8x8 matrix backpack"
  how_it_works: "Implements an SPI master to drive an animation with overlapping green/blue waves and a moving white diagonal. Some 7-segment wires are used for a 'sanity check' animation."
  how_to_test:  "Wire accordingly and use a clock up to 12.5 KHz. Asynchronous reset is synchronized to the clock."
